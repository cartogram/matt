# Customized, collaborative gift books for your favourite people

A joint venture with my partner, Fiona, Fondfolio helps you create a one of a kind book to honour a special person by collecting thoughtful words and stories from everyone they care about. While my involvement is limited to solely the online aspects, the true beauty in this product lies in the handcrafted physical books that Fiona creates and the loving responses contained within.

We started Fondfolio in 2016 and growth has been slow over the years, but there is a lot of reward in the [testimonials we get](https://thingtesting.com/brands/fondfolio#reviews).

I placed solid bets in Next.JS and Prisma (previously graph.cool) before they had real traction. Centering on React and GraphQL has proven undeniably as good idea over the years since. Outside of a Typescript rewrite at the end of 2020, the techstack behind Fondfolio has changed very little over the years.

Fondfolio is a proving ground for me to experiment and lead a faily complicated codebase on my own.
