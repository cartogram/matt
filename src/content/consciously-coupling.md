Throughout history, couples working together have been the norm. From ancestral farms to mom-and-pop shops, couples have toiled together to create an independent life for themselves and their families. We also see many examples of popular power-couples, from the historical (Mark Anthony & Cleopatra, Charles & Ray Eames) to those making waves today (Beyoncé & JayZ, Bill & Melinda Gates) all intelligently fusing together their individual talents to become unstoppable forces in their own industries, and beyond.

Teaming up for business with one’s significant other is still a phenomena alive and well today, and we’ve noticed that many of our favourite clients, collaborators, and local businesses have a cohabitational force at their core.

As a couple in business together ourselves, we’re interested in learning more about these successful work/life partnerships.
