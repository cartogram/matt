A new incident is the single greatest learning opportunity for beginner Resiliency engineers.

An incident opens up the possibility to make the platform better in the future. It exposes vulnerabilities and we make improvements that lessen the risks those vulnerabilities will lead to a repeat incident. This systematic incident review process is often referred to as a “Root Cause Analysis (RCA)” or the slightly more accepted term, “Postmortem”.

By reviewing incidents after they occur, we are given time to investigate the lead up events and gather a more accurate assessment of the impact, determine any missing follow-up steps to revive the platform (such as data recovery). We also want to be certain that a cascade of new, more complex problems doesn't exist in our system as a result of this incident. This investigation is a collaborative effort, and it is important that it remains constructive–avoiding any individual blame and focusing on strengthening the system. Individuals involved in the incident must be able to give details without fear of being punished for their mistakes. Less forthcoming engineers, means less exposure to the problems and less opportunity for improvement. Blaming others is not a solution, and often takes the focus away from a more valuable analysis and way-forward.

Postmortem culture is well documented in the technology world, where failure is relentless, constant and inevitable. Our systems are too complex for our own good and accidents will happen. By acknowledging and understanding this fact, we focus postmortems on learning new ways to build up the methods around how we respond and prevent failures from escalating.

## Running a Postmotem

1. Schedule a postmortem meeting and invite all the people involved in the incident.
1. Create a postmortem document and provide it to everyone you invited to the meeting.
1. Read over the Service Disruption information, study the timeline and be sure you understand everything that happened.
1. Run the postmortem meeting for roughly an hour. Start by summarizing the incident in your own words.
1. Follow the document outline. At the end, summarize the five whys and make sure there are no unanswered questions. Continue to prod until you feel like you’ve gotten to the lowest layer and uncover the “Second Story”.
1. The most important part is the long-term action items. Make sure these are clear and appropriately sized.
